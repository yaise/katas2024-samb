## Requirements

### Overview

ClearView is a supplemental HR platform that anonymizes candidate information while highlighting objective skills and qualifying experience to reduce bias in the hiring process. Clear View will also be service based, enabling DEI consultants to shadow employer interviews to rate the interviewer and report findings to executive management in an effort to proactively and strategically reduce bias in the interview process.

ClearView is a HR platform that leverages AI to construct stories about a job candidate based on S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goals, qualifications, and experience, that are then quantifiably aligned with open roles. All personal identifiable information and characteristics are eliminated until an objective determination is made on who the best candidate is to move forward with. The company pays to unlock the profile and data points are aggregated to reveal any disparities between those who are hired and those who were not selected.

ClearView attempts to solve:

1. The lack of impactful metrics that identify and reduce potential biases in the job candidate hiring and interview process.
2. The redundancy and ineffectiveness of the traditional ATS (applicant tracking software) matching viable candidates with job descriptions.
