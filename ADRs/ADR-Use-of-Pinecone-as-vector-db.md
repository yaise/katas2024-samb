# Use Pinecone as a Vector Database

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
We plan to use vector based search to efficiently match candidates with the job listings/employers. To ensure efficient,
 scalable, and real-time vector search, ClearView requires a specialized vector database solution.
 After evaluating various options, Pinecone has emerged as a leading candidate due to its performance,
 ease of integration, and scalability.

## Decision
ClearView will adopt Pinecone as the vector database for handling embedding storage and vector-based search functionalities. 
Pinecone will be integrated into the application to manage high-dimensional data and power key features such as:
- **Embedding Generation and Storage**: Efficiently store and manage vectors generated by machine learning models (e.g. candidate profile embeddings).
- **Similarity Search**: Provide fast and accurate retrieval of similar candidates, job descriptions, or anonymized resumes based on vector similarity.
- **Scalability**: Handle the growing volume of vectors as ClearView scales.

## Consequences
### Positive Outcomes:
- **Real-Time Search**: Pinecone’s low-latency search capabilities will enable fast and responsive similarity searches across millions of vectors.
- **Operational Efficiency**: As a managed service, Pinecone will offload the responsibility of managing the underlying infrastructure, reducing DevOps overhead.
- **Scalability**: Pinecone’s ability to scale horizontally will allow ClearView to handle an increasing number of embeddings and user queries without performance degradation.
- **Enhanced User Experience**:  Faster, more accurate search results will provide a better experience for both hiring managers and candidates.

### Potential Drawbacks:
- **Cost**: While Pinecone is cost-effective compared to managing infrastructure, there may still be concerns over 
long-term costs as the volume of vectors and queries increases.
