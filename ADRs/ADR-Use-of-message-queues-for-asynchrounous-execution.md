# Use Message Queue for Asynchronous Workflows in ClearView

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
ClearView has multiple use cases that involve resource-intensive, time-consuming computations that can be offloaded for asynchronous processing without affecting the user experience. Additionally, many LLM providers offer bulk embedding generation APIs, which can take up to 24 hours but are more cost-effective compared to immediate embedding generation. To ensure scalability and cost efficiency, it is essential to implement message queues in the solution.

## Decision
- We will use a message queue system to manage asynchronous workflows in ClearView.
- The message queue will act as the central mechanism for distributing tasks, such as embedding generation, to background workers or threads that will perform the computations and persist the results.
    - Tasks will be processed in the background, without blocking the main application flow.
    - Task retries and error handling will be efficiently managed.
    - The system will be scalable, enabling the application to handle an increasing number of asynchronous tasks as more users are onboarded.
    - The messaging system must natively support delayed message execution.

## Consequences
### Positive Outcomes:
- **Cost Efficiency**: A message queue system will help reduce operational costs by enabling delayed, bulk task execution.
- **Improved User Experience**: Offloading time-consuming tasks to background processes will enhance the responsiveness of the application.
- **Scalability**: The system will be able to scale its asynchronous task processing as needed, without overloading the main application.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: The message queue will provide better monitoring, task retries, and failure handling.

### Potential Drawbacks:
- **Operational Overhead**: Implementing a message queue introduces additional operational requirements, including management, monitoring, and scaling of the queue and workers.
