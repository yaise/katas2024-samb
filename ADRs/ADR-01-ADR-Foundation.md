# ADR foundation
## Proposal
We will use ADRs (architectural decision records) to keep track of 
major architectural decisions taken. Each ADR will follow the same structure: the proposal, the decision and the consequences. 

## Decision
Accepted

## Consequences
From now one ADRs will be stored in the ADRs folder, and they will be in the correct format.
