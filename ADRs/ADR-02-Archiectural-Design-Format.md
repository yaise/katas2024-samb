# ADR foundation
## Proposal
We will use the following:
1. The C4 design language to describe our architecture.
   2. We will cover the first 3 layers: Context, Container and Component.
   3. We won't cover Code since it is too specific and ill-defined at this point.
2. The architectural traits worksheet to specify and prioritize the architectural attributes (-ilities).

## Decision
Accepted

## Consequences
This git repo will contains files adhering to the accepted design format.
